- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an environment where bacteria and microorganisms can't survive, which is why it can last indefinitely. So, that jar of honey in your pantry might just be immortal!
